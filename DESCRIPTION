Description: Provides a set of functions to run a four‑state microsimulation.
    The model follows individuals through the health states Healthy (H), Sick (S1),
    Sicker (S2) and Dead (D). Transition probabilities may depend on the time
    spent in a state and on individual covariates such as age and sex. Costs and
    utilities are calculated at each cycle and aggregated with optional discounting.
