\title{Sample Health States}
\usage{
sampleV(m_trans_probs, v_states_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{m_trans_probs}{A matrix of transition probabilities with rows
corresponding to individuals and columns to states.}

\item{v_states_names}{Character vector of state names matching the
column order of \code{m_trans_probs}.}
}
\value{
A character vector of the sampled next state for each row of
\code{m_trans_probs}.
}
\description{
Samples the health state for each individual given their row of the
transition probability matrix. A multinomial sampling approach is used
whereby a uniform random number is compared against the cumulative
probabilities to determine the next state.
}
\examples{
m_probs <- matrix(
  data = c(0.8, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1),
  nrow = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)
colnames(m_probs) <- c("H", "S1", "S2", "D")
sampleV(
  m_trans_probs = m_probs, 
  v_states_names = colnames(m_probs)
)
