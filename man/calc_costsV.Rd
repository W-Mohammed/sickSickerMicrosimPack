\title{Calculate Costs}
\usage{
calc_costsV(v_occupied_state, v_states_costs, m_indi_features, v_cost_coeffs)
}
\arguments{
\item{v_occupied_state}{Character vector of current state for each
individual.}

\item{v_states_costs}{Named numeric vector of base costs for each state.}

\item{m_indi_features}{Matrix or data.frame of individual covariates with
rows corresponding to individuals and columns corresponding to features.
Must include a column named \code{age} which is incremented each cycle.}

\item{v_cost_coeffs}{Numeric vector of regression coefficients for costs.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of costs for the current cycle for each individual.
}
\description{
Computes the cost incurred by each individual in a cycle based on
their current health state and individual covariates. Costs for
states S1 and S2 can be modified by regression coefficients applied
to the individual features (e.g. age, sex).
}
\examples{
v_occupied_state <- c("H", "S1", "S2", "D")
v_states_costs <- c(H = 2000, S1 = 4000, S2 = 15000, D = 0)
m_indi_features <- cbind(age = c(50, 60, 70, 80), sex = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
v_cost_coeffs <- c(age = 11.5, sex = 300)

calc_costsV(
  v_occupied_state = v_occupied_state, 
  v_states_costs = v_states_costs, 
  m_indi_features = m_indi_features,
