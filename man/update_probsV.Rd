\title{Update Transition Probabilities}
\usage{
update_probsV(v_states_names, v_occupied_state, l_trans_probs, v_time_in_state)
}
\arguments{
\item{v_states_names}{Character vector of all possible health states.}

\item{v_occupied_state}{Character vector giving the current state for each
individual.}

\item{l_trans_probs}{A named list containing baseline transition
probabilities (\code{p_HD}, \code{p_HS1}, \code{p_S1H}, \code{p_S1S2}, \code{p_S1D}, \code{p_S2D}) and rate
ratios (\code{rp_S1}, \code{rp_S2}) used to update mortality probabilities.}

\item{v_time_in_state}{Numeric vector indicating the time each individual has
spent in their current state. Must be the same length as \code{v_occupied_state}.}
}
\value{
A matrix of transition probabilities with rows corresponding to
individuals and columns corresponding to the health states listed in
\code{v_states_names}. Each row sums to one.
}
\description{
Computes a transition probability matrix for each individual in the cohort
given the current health state, time spent in that state and a list of
baseline probabilities and modifiers. Probabilities are adjusted
for mortality using rate ratios and time in state. The resulting matrix
has one row per individual and one column for each possible next state.
