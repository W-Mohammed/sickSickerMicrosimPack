\usage{
calc_effsV(
  v_occupied_state,
  v_states_utilities,
  m_indi_features,
  v_util_coeffs,
  v_util_t_decs,
  v_time_in_state,
  cycle_length = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{v_occupied_state}{Character vector of current state for each
individual.}

\item{v_states_utilities}{Named numeric vector of base utilities for each
state.}

\item{m_indi_features}{Matrix or data.frame of individual covariates.}

\item{v_util_coeffs}{Numeric vector of regression coefficients for the
individual covariates used to calculate utility decrements.}

\item{v_util_t_decs}{Named numeric vector of timeâ€‘dependent utility
decrements for states S1 and S2. The names must correspond to state names.}

\item{v_time_in_state}{Numeric vector indicating the time spent in the
current state.}

\item{cycle_length}{Length of one cycle measured in years. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of QALYs for each individual over the cycle.
}
\description{
Computes the quality adjusted life years accrued in a single cycle for each
individual. Utilities for states S1 and S2 are adjusted by individual
covariate coefficients and by the time spent in the state.
