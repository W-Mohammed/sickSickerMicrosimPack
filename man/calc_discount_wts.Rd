\title{Calculate Discount Weights}
\usage{
calc_discount_wts(discount_rate, num_cycles, cycle_length)
}
\arguments{
\item{discount_rate}{Annual discount rate expressed as a fraction
(e.g. 0.03).}

\item{num_cycles}{Integer giving the number of cycles in the simulation.}

\item{cycle_length}{Length of each cycle in years.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of discount weights of length \code{num_cycles + 1}.
}
\description{
Computes discount weights for a sequence of cycles given a discount rate
expressed per annum and the length of each cycle. These weights can be
multiplied by costs or QALYs to obtain discounted values.
}
\examples{
calc_discount_wts(
  discount_rate = 0.03,
  num_cycles = 5, 
  cycle_length = 1
)
