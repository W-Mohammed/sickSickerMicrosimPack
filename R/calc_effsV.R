#' Calculate Health Outcomes (QALYs)
#'
#' Computes the quality adjusted life years accrued in a single cycle for each
#' individual. Utilities for states S1 and S2 are adjusted by individual
#' covariate coefficients and by the time spent in the state.
#'
#' @param v_occupied_state Character vector of current state for each
#' individual.
#' @param v_states_utilities Named numeric vector of base utilities for each
#' state.
#' @param m_indi_features Matrix or data.frame of individual covariates.
#' @param v_util_coeffs Numeric vector of regression coefficients for the
#' individual covariates used to calculate utility decrements.
#' @param v_util_t_decs Named numeric vector of timeâ€‘dependent utility 
#' decrements for states S1 and S2. The names must correspond to state names.
#' @param v_time_in_state Numeric vector indicating the time spent in the
#' current state.
#' @param cycle_length Length of one cycle measured in years. Defaults to 1.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector of QALYs for each individual over the cycle.
