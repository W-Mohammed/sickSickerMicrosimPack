#' Update Transition Probabilities
#'
#' Computes a transition probability matrix for each individual in the cohort
#' given the current health state, time spent in that state and a list of
#' baseline probabilities and modifiers. Probabilities are adjusted
#' for mortality using rate ratios and time in state. The resulting matrix
#' has one row per individual and one column for each possible next state.
#'
#' @param v_states_names Character vector of all possible health states.
#' @param v_occupied_state Character vector giving the current state for each
#' individual.
#' @param l_trans_probs A named list containing baseline transition
#' probabilities (`p_HD`, `p_HS1`, `p_S1H`, `p_S1S2`, `p_S1D`, `p_S2D`) and rate
#' ratios (`rp_S1`, `rp_S2`) used to update mortality probabilities.
#' @param v_time_in_state Numeric vector indicating the time each individual has
#' spent in their current state. Must be the same length as `v_occupied_state`.
#'
#' @return A matrix of transition probabilities with rows corresponding to
#'   individuals and columns corresponding to the health states listed in
#'   `v_states_names`. Each row sums to one.
