#' Update Transition Probabilities
#'
#' Computes a transition probability matrix for each individual in the cohort
#' given the current health state, time spent in that state and a list of
#' baseline probabilities and modifiers. Probabilities are adjusted
#' for mortality using rate ratios and time in state. The resulting matrix
#' has one row per individual and one column for each possible next state.

#'
#' @return A matrix of transition probabilities with rows corresponding to
#' individuals and columns corresponding to the health states listed in
#' `v_states_names`. Each row sums to one.
